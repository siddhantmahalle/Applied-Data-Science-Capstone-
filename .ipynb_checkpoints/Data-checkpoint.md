# Data

This data section is divided in two parts:
1. Venues and Location data obtained from FourSquare
2. Open source Chicago crime data 

## Data description

### Part 1 : FourSquare Data

This include following steps:
1. Query the FourSqaure website for the top sites in Chicago
2. Use the FourSquare API to get supplemental geographical data about the top sites
3. Use the FourSquare API to get top restaurent recommendations closest to each of the top site

#### Top Sites from FourSquare Website
Although FourSquare provides a comprehensive API, one of the things that API does not easily support is a mechanism to directly extract the top N sites / venues in a given city. This data, however, is easily available directly from the FourSquare Website. To do this simply go to www.foursquare.com, enter the city of your choise and select Top Picks from I'm Looking For selection field.

Using BeautifulSoup and Requests the results of the Top Pick for Chicago can retrieved. From this HTML the following data can be extracted:
* Venue Name
* Venue Score
* Venue Category
* Venue HREF
* Venue ID [Extracted from the HREF]

Here is a screenshot of extracted data:

#### Supplemental Geographical Data

Using the id field extracted from the HTML it is then possible to get further supplemental geographical details about each of the top sites from FourSquare using the following sample API call:

```python
# Get the properly formatted address and the latitude and longitude
url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/{}?client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}'.format(
    venue_id, 
    cfg['client_id'],
    cfg['client_secret'],
    cfg['version'])
    
result = requests.get(url).json()
result['response']['venue']['location']
```

The requests returns a JSON object which can then be queried for the details required. The last line in the sample code above returns the following sample JSON:

```json
{  
   "city":"Chicago",
   "lng":-87.62323915831546,
   "crossStreet":"btwn Columbus Dr & Michigan Ave",
   "neighborhood":"The Loop",
   "postalCode":"60601",
   "cc":"US",
   "formattedAddress":[  
      "201 E Randolph St (btwn Columbus Dr & Michigan Ave)",
      "Chicago, IL 60601",
      "United States"
   ],
   "state":"IL",
   "address":"201 E Randolph St",
   "lat":41.8826616030636,
   "country":"United States"
}
```

From this the following attributes are extracted:
* Venue Address
* Venue Postalcode
* Venue City
* Venue Latitude
* Venue Longitude

### Part 2: Chicago Crime Data

In this part I will be using open source Chicago crime data to provide the user with additional crime data.

This dataset can be download from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) and reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago in the last year, minus the most recent seven days. A full desription of the data is available on the site.

Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.
